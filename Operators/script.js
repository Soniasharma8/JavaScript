// Question 1: The value of num1 is 10 and the value of num2 is 5. Create a new variable sum and store the total of num1 and num2 in it. Print the sum in the console.

// let num1 = 10;
// let num2 = 5;
// let sum = num1 + num2;
// console.log(sum);

// Question 2: The value of appleCount is 20 and the value of eatenApples is 7. Create a variable remainingApples and store the count of remaining apples in it. Print remainingApples in the console.

// let appleCount = 20;
// let eatenApples = 7;
// let remainingApples = appleCount - eatenApples;
// console.log(remainingApples);

// Question 3: Multiplication: The value of pricePerItem is 15 and the value of quantity is 4. Create a variable totalCost and store the total cost in it. Print totalCost in the console.

// let pricePerItem = 15;
// let quantity =  4;
// let totalCost = pricePerItem * quantity;
// console.log(totalCost);

// Question 4: Division: The value of totalStudents is 50 and the value of groups is 10. Create a variable studentsPerGroup and calculate how many students will be there in each group. Print studentsPerGroup in the console.

// let totalStudents = 50;
// let groups = 10;
// let studentsPerGroup = totalStudents / groups;
// console.log(studentsPerGroup);

//Question 5: Modulus (Remainder): The value of total Chocolates is 23 and the value of students is 5. If every student gets equal number of chocolates, how many chocolates will be left? Create a variable remainingChocolates and store the remainder in it. Print remainingChocolates in the console.

// let totalchocolates = 23;
// let students = 7;
// let remainingChocolates = totalchocolates % students;
// console.log(remainingChocolates);


let score = 100;
score = score ++;
console.log(score); // Output: 101
